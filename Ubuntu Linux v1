                                      Networking
How does it work in Linux?Every operating system have networking without network no system can work even if it is in office, home, organization or any other system.
                                      IP
Every computer who needs to go on INTERNET it needs a address named IP address.There are many IP addresses internal & external.
GUI( Graphical interface user)
settings->networking->wired                     (to see IP, hardware & other address details from GUI)
IPV4                                            (old IP address )
IPV6                                            (New IP address)
Hardware address                                (Mac or burn in address)
Default route                                   (if computer needs to go on INTERNET from outside the home it will go through default route)
DNS(Domain name service)                        (Because of this we know the name of every IP like Google,Facebook etc)
DHCP(Domain host configuration protocol)
sudo apt install net-tools                      (To install net tools)
ifconfig                                        (To see all important properties)
ifconfig |grep inet                             (To see IP address)
ifconfig | grep HWaddr/ether                    (To hardware address)
Default gateway if you are going to internet you must know where ?
dhclient                                        (To check rtlink file)
dhclient -r                                     (To release or change IP, It kills connection & refresh IP)
nslookup distrowach.org                         (to check what is your distro & sever)
nslookup google.com
